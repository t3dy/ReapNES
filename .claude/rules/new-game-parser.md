# New Game Parser Checklist

Before writing ANY code for a new game, complete these steps IN ORDER:

1. **Mapper** — read rom[6-7] for mapper type. 0=linear, 1/2/4=bank-switched.
2. **Disassembly** — check references/ for annotated disassembly. If exists, READ IT.
3. **Driver ID** — scan for E8+DX and FE+count+addr patterns. No hits = not Maezawa. STOP.
4. **Pointer table** — find from disassembly, NOT by scanning. No disassembly = Mesen debugger.
5. **DX byte count** — how many bytes after DX? CV1=2, Contra=3/1. Read the disassembly.
6. **$C0-$CF** — rest with duration or instantaneous mute? Read sound_cmd_routine_00.
7. **Percussion** — inline E9/EA (CV1) or separate channel with DMC (Contra)?
8. **Parse ONE track, listen** — compare to game before batch-extracting.

See extraction/drivers/konami/spec.md for the per-game differences table.
